# pyramid-survey

This is a small survey web application I created for people at a university
to survey groups of students or staff for various reasons.

It's a standard pyramid application which can be setup by doing the following:

```
create a python virtualenv
cd <directory containing this file>
$venv/bin/python setup.py develop
$venv/bin/populate_survey development.ini
$venv/bin/pserve development.ini
```
